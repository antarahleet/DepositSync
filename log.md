# Development Log

## 2024-12-19 14:30 - Step 0: Project Setup

### Actions Taken
- Initialized Git repository
- Verified no remote is configured yet

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript, Supabase (DB + Storage), OpenAI API, Vercel hosting, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
  - Reasoning: Low cost, excellent developer experience, good integration capabilities
- **Project Structure**: Single `log.md` file for both actions and decisions
  - Reasoning: Simpler file structure, easier to maintain audit trail
- **Security Approach**: Server-only env vars, webhook authentication, RLS disabled initially
  - Reasoning: MVP focus, can add auth later, server-side operations are secure

**Files Changed:**
- `log.md` (updated structure)

**Commands Run:**
- `git init` - initialized empty Git repository
- `git remote -v` - verified no remote configured

**Status:** Ready for GitHub repository setup and tech stack confirmation

## 2024-12-19 14:35 - Step 0: Cleanup
- Removed empty `docs/` folder
- Reasoning: Simplified project structure, keeping everything in `log.md`

**Files Changed:**
- Removed `docs/` directory

**Commands Run:**
- `rmdir docs` - removed empty docs directory
