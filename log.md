# Development Log

## 2025-08-07 - Filters, CSV Export, Schema Hardening, and UI Enhancements ‚úÖ

### Actions Taken
1.  Added environment template `.env.local.example` and aligned README env docs.
2.  Hardened DB schema:
    - Converted `Check.status` to Prisma enum (`parsed | needs_review`).
    - Added indexes on `createdAt`, `checkNumber`, `payor`, `payee`, `memo`.
3.  Backend improvements:
    - `/api/checks` GET supports pagination (`page`, `pageSize`) and filters: `dateFrom/dateTo`, `amountMin/amountMax` alongside `query`.
    - Added Zod validation of OpenAI output in POST and auto-assign `status: parsed` when key fields exist.
    - Gated verbose logs to non-production.
    - Secured `/api/debug` in production with `?secret=` matching `INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
    - Created `/api/checks/export` to download filtered results as CSV.
    - OpenAI client now requests `response_format: json_object` and logs only in dev.
4.  Frontend enhancements:
    - `/checks` page: date and amount filters, pagination controls, CSV export link, and full image preview modal.
    - Switched thumbnails to `next/image` for baseline optimization.
    - `/checks/[id]`: ‚ÄúMark as Reviewed‚Äù button to set status to `parsed`.
5.  UI/Build:
    - Enabled `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio` plugin; installed dev dependency.
    - Removed legacy Turso artifacts: `schema.sql` and `scripts/setup-db.js`.

### Files Changed
- `.env.local.example` (added)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (enum + indexes)
- `app/api/checks/route.ts` (filters, pagination, validation, quieter logs)
- `app/api/checks/[id]/route.ts` (review default on update)
- `app/api/checks/export/route.ts` (new CSV export)
- `app/api/debug/route.ts` (prod gating with secret)
- `lib/openai.ts` (response_format json, dev-only logging)
- `app/checks/page.tsx` (filters, pagination, preview modal, export)
- `app/checks/[id]/page.tsx` (Mark as Reviewed)
- `tailwind.config.ts` (aspect-ratio plugin)
- `package.json` (added `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio`)
- `README.md` (env notes)
- Removed: `schema.sql`, `scripts/setup-db.js`

### Commands Run
```bash
npm i --save-dev @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio
# Suggested locally after pulling:
# npx prisma generate
# npx prisma db push
```

### Status
‚úÖ Filters, pagination, CSV export, and preview modal live
‚úÖ Schema safer (enum) with useful indexes
‚úÖ Debug route secured in production
üîÑ Optional next: review reasons/notes, modal UX, CSV columns tuning

## 2024-12-20 - Feature Implementation & Bug Squashing ‚úÖ

### Actions Taken
1.  **Implemented Home Button**: Added a global navigation header in `app/layout.tsx` with a link to the homepage, improving site-wide navigation.
2.  **Implemented Search Functionality**:
    - Added a search bar to the `/checks` page.
    - Integrated the `use-debounce` hook to optimize search queries and prevent excessive API calls.
    - Updated the `/api/checks` GET endpoint to accept a `query` parameter and perform a case-insensitive search across `checkNumber`, `payor`, `payee`, and `memo` fields.
3.  **Fixed Compilation Errors**:
    - Resolved a `ReferenceError` for a missing `Link` import.
    - Corrected a syntax error (`check..id` to `check.id`) in `app/checks/page.tsx`.

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
-   **Global Navigation**: Placing the home button in the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) ensures it is present on every page, providing a consistent user experience.
-   **Debounced Search**: Using `use-debounce` on the frontend is a best practice to avoid overwhelming the backend with requests for every keystroke. It waits for the user to pause typing before sending the query.
-   **Backend Search Logic**: The API now uses Prisma's `contains` filter with `mode: 'insensitive'` for a flexible and user-friendly search experience, allowing partial matches on key fields.

### Files Changed
-   `app/layout.tsx`: Added a site-wide header and home button.
-   `app/checks/page.tsx`: Implemented the search bar UI, state management with `useState`, and debounced search logic. Fixed a syntax error.
-   `app/api/checks/route.ts`: Modified the GET request handler to filter database results based on the search query.
-   `package.json` & `package-lock.json`: Added `use-debounce` dependency.
-   `future-checklist.md`: Marked "Home button" and "Search functionality" as complete.

### Commands Run
```bash
npm i use-debounce
```

### Status
‚úÖ **Features Complete**: Home button and search functionality are fully implemented and working.
‚úÖ **Bugs Fixed**: All outstanding compilation errors have been resolved.
üîÑ **Ready for Next Task**: The application is stable and ready for the next feature implementation.

## 2024-12-19 - Vercel Deployment Debugging & Final Fix ‚úÖ

### Actions Taken
1.  **Identified Caching Issue**: Vercel was running old code despite new deployments
2.  **Added Debugging Tools**: Created `/api/debug` and `/api/test-env` endpoints for troubleshooting
3.  **Implemented Robust JSON Parsing**: Enhanced `lib/openai.ts` with bulletproof JSON extraction
4.  **Added Visual Confirmation**: Changed homepage title to "DepositSync V3" to verify deployment
5.  **Resolved Git Merge Conflicts**: Successfully merged and pushed all changes

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
**Vercel Caching Problem**: The deployment was running cached code instead of the latest version
-   **Symptoms**: Identical error logs despite code changes
-   **Root Cause**: Vercel's build cache was serving old compiled code
-   **Solution**: Force new deployment with visual confirmation

**Robust JSON Extraction**: Replaced simple string replacement with intelligent JSON block detection
-   **Problem**: OpenAI sometimes wraps JSON in markdown backticks
-   **Solution**: Find `{` and `}` positions to extract valid JSON regardless of formatting
-   **Implementation**: `content.substring(startIndex, endIndex + 1)` instead of regex replacement

**Git Workflow Issues**: Encountered merge conflicts during deployment
-   **Problem**: Local and remote branches had diverged
-   **Solution**: Completed merge and pushed consolidated changes
-   **Result**: Clean deployment with all fixes included

### Files Changed
-   `lib/openai.ts` - Implemented robust JSON extraction with logging
-   `app/page.tsx` - Added "V3" to title for deployment verification
-   `app/api/debug/route.ts` - Created environment variable debugging endpoint
-   `app/api/test-env/route.ts` - Created production environment testing endpoint
-   `app/api/checks/route.ts` - Enhanced error logging for debugging

### Commands Run
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: implement robust JSON extraction from OpenAI response"
git push origin clean-main
git pull origin clean-main
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts and complete merge"
git push origin clean-main
```

### Status
‚úÖ **Deployment Fixed**: Vercel now runs the latest code with robust JSON parsing
‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: All required variables are configured in Vercel
‚úÖ **Full Functionality**: Check upload, AI extraction, and database storage working
üîÑ **Ready for Production**: Application is fully functional on Vercel

## 2024-12-19 - Vercel Deployment Success ‚úÖ

### Actions Taken
1.  **Fixed Prisma Build Issue**: Updated `package.json` build script to include `prisma generate`
2.  **Pushed Fix to GitHub**: Committed and pushed the build script fix to `clean-main` branch
3.  **Successful Deployment**: Vercel deployment completed successfully after the fix

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
**Build Script Update**: Changed from `"build": "next build"` to `"build": "prisma generate && next build"`
-   **Problem**: Vercel caches dependencies, causing outdated Prisma Client
-   **Solution**: Force Prisma Client generation during build process
-   **Result**: Eliminated `PrismaClientInitializationError` on Vercel

**Deployment Strategy**: Using `clean-main` branch as default
-   **Reasoning**: Avoided GitHub push protection issues with sensitive data in history
-   **Benefits**: Clean deployment without API key exposure

### Files Changed
-   `package.json` - Updated build script to include `prisma generate`

### Commands Run
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: run 'prisma generate' during Vercel build"
git push origin clean-main
```

### Status
‚úÖ **Deployment Successful**: Application is now live on Vercel
üîÑ **Ready for Environment Setup**: Need to add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
üìã **Next Steps**: Configure `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in Vercel

---

## 2024-12-19 - OpenAI API Key Setup & Testing Preparation ‚úÖ

### Actions Taken
1.  **Added OpenAI API Key** to `.env` file
2.  **Modified API Route** to work without Vercel Blob for testing
3.  **Improved Error Handling** in frontend to prevent JSON parse errors
4.  **Added Fallback Image Storage** using base64 data URLs for testing

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
**Temporary Blob Storage**: Using base64 data URLs instead of Vercel Blob for initial testing
-   **Reasoning**: Allows testing of OpenAI Vision functionality without setting up Vercel Blob first
-   **Implementation**: Converts uploaded files to base64 data URLs for immediate testing
-   **Future**: Will switch to Vercel Blob for production storage

**Environment Variable Setup**: Added OpenAI API key to `.env`
-   **Reasoning**: Enables AI processing functionality
-   **Security**: API key is stored in environment variables, not in code

### Files Changed
-   `.env` - Added OpenAI API key
-   `app/api/checks/route.ts` - Modified to work without Vercel Blob
-   `app/checks/page.tsx` - Improved error handling

### Status
‚úÖ **OpenAI Integration**: Ready for testing with real check images
üîÑ **Ready for Testing**: Can now upload check images and test AI processing
üìã **Next Steps**: Test with a real check image to see AI extraction in action

## 2024-12-19 - TypeScript Path Mapping Fix ‚úÖ

### Problem
Module resolution errors when importing from `@/lib/db`, `@/lib/blob`, and `@/lib/openai`:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/db'
```

### Root Cause
The `tsconfig.json` was missing the path mapping configuration for the `@` alias.

### Solution
Added `baseUrl` and `paths` configuration to `tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... existing config
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Files Changed
-   `tsconfig.json` - Added path mapping for `@` alias

### Status
‚úÖ **Fixed**: All import paths now resolve correctly
üîÑ **Development Server**: Restarted to apply configuration changes

## 2024-12-19 - Neon Database Setup Success ‚úÖ

### Actions Taken
1.  **Updated Environment Configuration**:
    -   Updated `.env.local` with Neon PostgreSQL connection string
    -   Updated `.env` file (which was overriding `.env.local`) with correct Neon URL
    -   Fixed environment variable loading issue

2.  **Database Schema Deployment**:
    -   Successfully ran `npx prisma db push` to create tables in Neon
    -   Generated Prisma Client for PostgreSQL
    -   Verified database connection is working

3.  **Database Testing**:
    -   Started Prisma Studio for database inspection
    -   Confirmed connection to Neon PostgreSQL database

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
**Environment File Priority**: The `.env` file was overriding `.env.local` because Prisma reads `.env` by default.
-   **Solution**: Updated the `.env` file directly with the Neon connection string
-   **Reasoning**: Ensures Prisma uses the correct database URL

**Connection String Format**: Used the full Neon connection string with SSL and channel binding parameters.
-   **Reasoning**: Neon requires SSL for security, and the connection string includes all necessary parameters

### Files Changed
-   `.env` - Updated with Neon PostgreSQL connection string
-   `.env.local` - Updated with Neon connection string (backup)

### Commands Run
```bash
npm install dotenv
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push  # ‚úÖ SUCCESS
npx prisma studio   # Started for database inspection
```

### Status
‚úÖ **Database Setup Complete**: Neon PostgreSQL is connected and schema is deployed
üîÑ **Ready for Step 3**: API route development can now proceed

## 2024-12-19 - Database Architecture Pivot: Turso ‚Üí Neon

### Technical Decision & Reasoning
**Problem**: Prisma was failing to connect to Turso with errors:
-   `Error validating datasource db: the URL must start with the protocol file:` (P1012)
-   `Cannot fetch data from service: fetch failed` (P5010)

**Research Findings**: 
-   Prisma has limited support for remote SQLite databases like Turso
-   Turso uses libsql (SQLite-compatible) which requires different connection handling
-   Prisma works best with PostgreSQL databases
-   Neon provides excellent Prisma compatibility with PostgreSQL

**Solution**: Switch to Neon (PostgreSQL) for better Prisma support and smoother development experience.

### Actions Taken
1.  **Updated Environment Variables** (`.env.local.example`):
    -   Changed from Turso libsql URL to Neon PostgreSQL URL format
    -   Updated comments to reflect Neon setup

2.  **Updated Prisma Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
    -   Changed provider from `"sqlite"` to `"postgresql"`
    -   Updated field names to use camelCase (Prisma convention):
        -   `check_number` ‚Üí `checkNumber`
        -   `image_url` ‚Üí `imageUrl` 
        -   `created_at` ‚Üí `createdAt`

3.  **Updated Documentation** (`README.md`):
    -   Changed tech stack from "Neon or Turso" to "Neon (PostgreSQL)"
    -   Updated setup instructions for Neon
    -   Simplified architecture description

### Next Steps
-   User needs to create Neon account and database
-   Update `.env.local` with Neon connection string
-   Run `npx prisma db push` to create tables
-   Continue with Step 3 (API route development)

### Files Changed
-   `.env.local.example` - Updated for Neon PostgreSQL
-   `prisma/schema.prisma` - Changed provider and field names
-   `README.md` - Updated tech stack and setup instructions
