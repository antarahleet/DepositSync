# Development Log

## 2024-12-19 14:30 - Step 0: Project Setup

### Actions Taken
- Initialized Git repository
- Verified no remote is configured yet

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) + TypeScript, Supabase (DB + Storage), OpenAI API, Vercel hosting, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
  - Reasoning: Low cost, excellent developer experience, good integration capabilities
- **Project Structure**: Single `log.md` file for both actions and decisions
  - Reasoning: Simpler file structure, easier to maintain audit trail
- **Security Approach**: Server-only env vars, webhook authentication, RLS disabled initially
  - Reasoning: MVP focus, can add auth later, server-side operations are secure

**Files Changed:**
- `log.md` (updated structure)

**Commands Run:**
- `git init` - initialized empty Git repository
- `git remote -v` - verified no remote configured

**Status:** Ready for GitHub repository setup and tech stack confirmation

## 2024-12-19 14:35 - Step 0: Cleanup
- Removed empty `docs/` folder
- Reasoning: Simplified project structure, keeping everything in `log.md`

**Files Changed:**
- Removed `docs/` directory

**Commands Run:**
- `rmdir docs` - removed empty docs directory

## 2024-12-19 14:40 - Step 1: Repo Bootstrap

### Actions Taken
- Created package.json with valid npm name "deposit-sync"
- Installed Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and ESLint
- Added Tailwind CSS configuration
- Installed Supabase and Zod dependencies
- Created basic Next.js app structure with App Router
- Built homepage with link to /checks
- Created health check API endpoint
- Created feature branch and committed changes

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **Package Name**: Used "deposit-sync" instead of "DepositSync" 
  - Reasoning: npm naming restrictions don't allow capital letters
- **Next.js Setup**: Used App Router with TypeScript
  - Reasoning: Latest Next.js features, type safety, better performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: Manual configuration instead of CLI
  - Reasoning: CLI had issues on Windows, manual setup is more reliable
- **Dependencies**: Added @supabase/supabase-js and zod early
  - Reasoning: Core dependencies needed for database and validation

**Files Changed:**
- `package.json` (new) - Next.js app configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` (new) - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `postcss.config.js` (new) - PostCSS configuration
- `app/globals.css` (new) - Global styles with Tailwind
- `app/layout.tsx` (new) - Root layout component
- `app/page.tsx` (new) - Homepage with dashboard link
- `app/api/health/route.ts` (new) - Health check endpoint
- `.gitignore` (new) - Exclude node_modules and build files

**Commands Run:**
- `npm install` - installed Next.js dependencies
- `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` - added Tailwind
- `npm install @supabase/supabase-js zod` - added core dependencies
- `git checkout -b feat/step-01-bootstrap` - created feature branch
- `git add -A` - staged all files
- `git commit -m "chore: bootstrap Next.js app, tailwind, health endpoint"` - committed changes

**Status:** Ready for local development testing

## 2024-12-19 14:45 - Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup

### Actions Taken
- Created GitHub repository "DepositSync" via CLI
- Set up remote origin pointing to GitHub
- Pushed feature branch to GitHub
- Created and pushed main branch
- Switched to main branch for future development

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **Repository Name**: Used "DepositSync" (with capital letters)
  - Reasoning: Matches project folder name, GitHub allows capitals in repo names
- **Branch Strategy**: Simplified to push directly to main
  - Reasoning: Faster development workflow, can add branches later if needed
- **Public Repository**: Made repository public
  - Reasoning: Easier deployment to Vercel, no sensitive data in code

**Files Changed:**
- None (repository setup only)

**Commands Run:**
- `gh repo create DepositSync --public --source=. --remote=origin --push` - created GitHub repo
- `git checkout -b main` - created main branch
- `git push -u origin main` - pushed main branch to GitHub

**Status:** Ready for Step 2 - Environment & Secrets Skeleton

## 2024-12-19 14:50 - Step 2: Environment & Secrets Skeleton

### Actions Taken
- Created `.env.local.example` with all required environment variables
- Built `lib/env.ts` for server-side environment validation
- Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- Committed and pushed changes to GitHub

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **Environment Validation**: Used Zod schema validation in `lib/env.ts`
  - Reasoning: Type-safe environment variable checking, prevents runtime errors
- **Server-Only Validation**: Environment validation only runs on server
  - Reasoning: Keeps sensitive keys secure, prevents client-side exposure
- **Comprehensive README**: Added detailed setup instructions
  - Reasoning: Makes project easy to understand and contribute to

**Files Changed:**
- `.env.local.example` (new) - Template for environment variables
- `lib/env.ts` (new) - Environment validation helper
- `README.md` (new) - Project documentation and setup guide

**Commands Run:**
- `git add -A` - staged all new files
- `git commit -m "feat: add environment setup and documentation"` - committed changes
- `git push` - pushed to GitHub main branch

**Status:** Ready for Step 3 - Supabase Project & Schema

## 2024-12-19 14:55 - Step 2: Tailwind CSS Fix

### Actions Taken
- Installed @tailwindcss/postcss package for Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility
- Updated postcss.config.js to use the correct plugin
- Committed and pushed the fix to GitHub

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **PostCSS Plugin**: Used @tailwindcss/postcss instead of tailwindcss
  - Reasoning: Tailwind CSS v4 moved the PostCSS plugin to a separate package
- **Quick Fix**: Applied the fix immediately when user reported the error
  - Reasoning: Ensures development server works properly before proceeding

**Files Changed:**
- `postcss.config.js` (updated) - Fixed PostCSS plugin reference
- `package.json` (updated) - Added @tailwindcss/postcss dependency
- `tsconfig.json` (new) - TypeScript configuration

**Commands Run:**
- `npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss` - installed correct PostCSS plugin
- `git add -A` - staged changes
- `git commit -m "fix: update tailwind postcss plugin for v4 compatibility"` - committed fix
- `git push` - pushed to GitHub

**Status:** Ready for Step 3 - Supabase Project & Schema

## 2024-12-19 15:00 - Step 2: Tailwind CSS v3 Downgrade

### Actions Taken
- Uninstalled Tailwind CSS v4 and @tailwindcss/postcss
- Installed Tailwind CSS v3.4.0 for better compatibility
- Updated postcss.config.js to use standard tailwindcss plugin
- Restarted development server
- Committed and pushed the fix to GitHub

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **Tailwind CSS Version**: Downgraded from v4 to v3.4.0
  - Reasoning: v4 has compatibility issues with current Next.js setup, v3 is more stable
- **Plugin Configuration**: Reverted to standard tailwindcss plugin
  - Reasoning: v3 uses the standard plugin, no separate PostCSS package needed
- **Immediate Fix**: Applied fix when user reported styling issues
  - Reasoning: Ensures proper visual appearance before proceeding to next steps

**Files Changed:**
- `postcss.config.js` (updated) - Reverted to standard tailwindcss plugin
- `package.json` (updated) - Changed to tailwindcss v3.4.0

**Commands Run:**
- `npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss` - removed v4 packages
- `npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.4.0 postcss autoprefixer` - installed v3
- `git add -A` - staged changes
- `git commit -m "fix: downgrade to tailwindcss v3 for better compatibility"` - committed fix
- `git push` - pushed to GitHub

**Status:** Ready for Step 3 - Database Setup (Neon/Turso)

## 2024-12-19 15:05 - Step 2: Architecture Pivot

### Actions Taken
- Updated environment variables to use new architecture
- Changed from Supabase to Neon/Turso + Vercel Blob
- Updated README.md to reflect new tech stack
- Modified lib/env.ts for new environment validation

### Technical Decisions & Reasoning
- **Architecture Pivot**: Switched from Supabase to Neon/Turso + Vercel Blob
  - Reasoning: Faster MVP development, better free tiers, simpler setup
- **Manual Upload First**: Replaced email parsing with frontend upload
  - Reasoning: Faster testing and iteration, can add email later
- **Unified API**: Single `/api/checks` endpoint for all processing
  - Reasoning: Simpler architecture, reusable for future webhook integration
- **Frontend-First**: Immediate UI instead of backend-only testing
  - Reasoning: Better user experience and faster development feedback

**Files Changed:**
- `.env.local.example` (updated) - New environment variables
- `lib/env.ts` (updated) - Updated validation schema
- `README.md` (updated) - New tech stack and setup instructions

**Commands Run:**
- None (file updates only)

**Status:** Ready for Step 3 - Database Setup (Neon/Turso)
